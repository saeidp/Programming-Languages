// ---------------------------------------------- How modules are created ---------------------------
// In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level import or export is considered a module.
// If you have a file that doesnâ€™t currently have any imports or exports, but you want to be treated as a module, add the line:
// export { };

export { }
